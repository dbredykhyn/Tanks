# Tanks
This is primitive implementation of an old game Tanks 1990 that was made by my team.
This game was written in C using ncurses library, so before launch it, you need to instal ncurses before.
Code is open, so you can modify it by your own.

Control for players:

Player 1(blue):
wasd - for moving;
f - for fire;

Player 2(red):
Key arrows - for moving;
0 key - for fire;

Game will end when one of players get 5 score.
